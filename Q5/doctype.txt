The DOCTYPE Declaration - The DOCTYPE declaration is an important declaration in HTML that specifies the type and version of the document being used.
                          It is placed at the very beginning of an HTML document to tell web browsers and other parsers which version of HTML is being used,
                          as well as how the document should be interpreted and rendered. 
                          The DOCTYPE Declaration is used in HTML5.
